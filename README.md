## Modzy_API Functions

The Modzy_API module lets you interact with the Modzy API using CURL. A lot of the annoyance of setting up, executing, and returning a result has been abstracted away. The main functions you'll likely want to use are:

`ModzyJobSubmission`
This function accepts a JSON string of the full request you'd like to submit to Modzy and returns the reponse provided by the /api/jobs endpoint. This response includes the JobID generated when a job is successfully submitted to Modzy which can be used to query the result of that job.

`ModzyResults`
This function accepts a valid Job ID and returns the results of any inference that has been successfully completed.

`ModzyJobDetails`
This function GETs a jobâ€™s details. It includes the status, total, completed, and failed number of items
